# Html-Website
this is my new html Website you can use it freely
# Alert
Due to the mit license your required to give the "https://dsc.gg/zillahyps" link beside your home page (please add it to the top I would be happy :)
# how to use this.
1. Well first follow me and star my first public repo in along time ;)
2. Download the project
3. Add your part of the code
4. Re check if everything is up to date
5. And your good to go!
# how do I not mess up
I will make future changes so it is important for you to NOT git pull it immediately cause your just gonna lose your progress, instead look at the code and copy it or we'll just find a way to not ruin your code
### enjoy this project and do give me a rating if possible
:)
